# HeelHeal
## What is HeelHeal
Other than being a great play on words, HeelHeal takes an early examination of wounds. Our first focus was to examine foot injuries and estimate their time to heal. This application can be used for all physical injuries.  
  
## How does it work?  
A user takes a picture of their wound with a ruler for reference. The app then asks the user to draw a perimeter around the wound. Then provide two dots on the ruler marking one inch. The app will then send the user to a results page where information regarding the wound's heal time is shown alongside the image of the wound.  

This approximation is done by looking at the longest distance of the wound and calculating the wounds time based of a 1mm to 5mm healing process. Results will be saved locally and can be viewed at any later date.
    
## Why did we make it?  
A professor at UNM works as a foot doctor, and the complaints he had were that many of the injuries could have been easily sorted and analyzed through automation. The current proudcts right now are slow and inefficient.

## How did we make it?  
The entire project is written in native Java, using Android studio to create a funtional app and interface.
